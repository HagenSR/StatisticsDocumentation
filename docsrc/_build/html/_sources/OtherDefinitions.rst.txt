Other definitions that I find useful

Population
=================

a set of all measurements of interest ​Or, the totality of observations with which we are concerned​

**Example**: we are interested in the number of classes a student at NDSU will take in a year.​

The population would be the number of classes taken in a year for every student.​

Parameter
=================

A parameter is a numerical measure of a population.​

The average number of classes an NDSU student takes would be µ, the mean, and it would be found using information from the whole population (all students).​

It is not always possible to find data for an entire population, so we estimate parameter values using statistics.​

Sample
=================

A sample is a subset of a population.​ In our example we could sample 500 NDSU students and record how many classes they are taking.​
In order for our inferences from a sample to the population to be valid, we must obtain samples that are representative of the population.​
We cannot simply sample data which is convenient.​ Any sampling procedure that consistently over/underestimates some characteristic of the population is said to be biased.​
To eliminate any possibility of bias in the sampling procedure, it is desirable to choose a random sample in the sense that the observations are made independently and at random. 

Random Sample
=================

f we select a random sample of size n from a population with some distribution f(x), then x1, x2, …, xn are the numerical values sampled.​
If the measurements are obtained by repeating the experiment n independent times under essentially the same conditions, the sample is random.​

Statistic
=================

A statistic is a numerical measure of a sample, or any function of the random variables constituting a random sample.​

We could estimate the average number of classes for each student by finding a “sample mean” instead of using the whole population.​

Measures of Center
==================

The measure of center we have discussed for a population is the mean, µ.​ Population parameters are in no way affected or influenced by the observations of a random sample.
